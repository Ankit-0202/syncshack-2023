      "Extreme weather events"
    ],
    "notes": "Let's start by defining climate change. Climate change refers to long-term shifts in temperature and weather patterns caused primarily by human activities. The main causes of climate change include greenhouse gas emissions and deforestation. Some examples of climate change effects are rising temperatures, melting ice caps, and an increase in extreme weather events."

    "notes": "Now, let's shift our focus to biodiversity. Biodiversity refers to the variety of living organisms in a particular habitat or ecosystem. It includes genetic diversity, species diversity, and ecosystem diversity. Biodiversity plays a crucial role in ecosystem functioning, such as providing essential ecosystem services, maintaining a stable climate, and supporting the food web."

    "image_prompts": [
      "Coral bleaching",
      "Forest fires",
      "Polar bear on melting ice"
    ],
    "notes": "Now, let's explore how climate change poses threats to biodiversity. Climate change disrupts ecosystems and habitats, leading to changes in temperature, precipitation patterns, and sea levels. These changes can cause coral bleaching, forest fires, and the loss of ice habitats for species like polar bears. Ultimately, climate change accelerates species extinction and reduces overall biodiversity."

      "Reforestation",
      "Habitat restoration"
    ],
    "notes": "Despite the challenges, conservation efforts play a vital role in mitigating the impacts of climate change on biodiversity. Examples of conservation strategies include establishing protected areas, implementing reforestation projects, and restoring degraded habitats. Additionally, adaptation measures for biodiversity, such as assisted migration and habitat connectivity, can help species cope with changing environmental conditions."
